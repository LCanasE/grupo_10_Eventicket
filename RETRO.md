1. KEEP DOING – These are things that energize the team, is adding value and something the team is doing well and you recognize the value on it. What are the good things in your project or what will people miss if it isn’t there?

   

2. LESS OF – These are practices that are already being done but might need refining because it is not currently helpful or productive in the current situation. This could be as simple as a behaviour, an activity or a routine that is not efficient or value adding in its current form.

   

3. MORE OF – These might be practices, technologies or activities that team members think there should be more of or is not currently being taken full advantage of. This might be additional paired programming or running more short sharp meetings.

    

4. STOP DOING – These are things that are not bringing value, or even worse, getting in the way.  It’s time for these to go.

    

5. START DOING – a new idea, or  something you have seen working before that you would like to bring to the table. It might be something simple or just to keep things dynamic and fun. While the ideal scenario is to do each topic one by one, you can also open it up so that people can add ideas under any of the sections when they are ready. You can then discuss them in the above order.
